# flexmoney-assignment


# I have used React.js for frontend of the assignment.

# I have used Node.js and Express for the backend.

# I have used MySQL as the database.

# Coming to the problem statement, the main part of the assignment is to check weather the user is already registered or not. I have used phone number as the key
to check weather the user with same phone number exists or not, because the phone number is always unique for all the registered people.

# All the data of users is stored in "users" table

# For payment part, I have stored the details in "payments" table.

#As told in the problem statement I have not implemented completePayments() function.
